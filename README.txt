This project contains my modifications to the Phylogenetic Analysis Library, version 1.5.1.
Drummond, A., and K. Strimmer. 2001. PAL: An object-oriented programming library for molecular evolution and phylogenetics. Bioinformatics 17: 662-663. 

The PAL library and my modifications are released under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

I am making this release in support of the paper
M. Woodhams, J. Fernandez-Sanchez and J Sumner, 2015, A New Hierarchy of Phylogenetic Models Consistent with Heterogeneous
Sustitution Rates, accepted for publication in Systematic Biology .

Further software in support of this paper is available at datadryad.org. It was necessary to release this library separately
because of licensing issues (all software stored on datadryad.org is licensed under Creative Commons Zero, and I
can't relicense PAL.)

Some (fairly extensive) modifications from base PAL were for a project which did not produce publishible results. 
The modification which is significant for current purposes (Lie Markov DNA substitution models) is to allow for
non time-reversible models.
